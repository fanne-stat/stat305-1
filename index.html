<h1>STAT 305. Engineering Statistics</h1>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Students will understand statistical studies. They will learn about
    observational studies, experimental studies, key differences between the two,
    and the types of conclusions that can be drawn from each.</li>
<li>Students will learn how to summarize data using numerical summaries and
    statistical plots. They will learn how to use these tools to draw
    key information about the data relevant to the problem at hand.</li>
<li>Students will understand the concept of a random variable and
    learn how to model measured quantities in statistical studies as random variables.
    They will use random variables to calculate means, variances, probabilities,
    and quantiles. They will learn to work with commonly used random variables
    such as binomial, geometric, Poisson, normal, and t random variables.</li>
<li>Students will understand confidence intervals, along with how to use and interpret
    them effectively. They will also learn how to rigorously draw conclusions from
    data using hypothesis tests.</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Course materials</h2>

All course materials will be posted at <a href="http://wlandau.github.com/stat305/materials.html">
will-landau.com/stat305/materials.html</a>. These include lecture notes, homework assignments,
data, and any supplemental materials.<br/><br/>

<h2>The Wiki</h2>

There is a wiki for this class at 
<a href="https://stat305d-spring2013.wikispaces.com/home">
https://stat305d-spring2013.wikispaces.com/home</a>. To access the wiki:<br/>

<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com">wikispaces.com</a> and create an account
    if you don't already have one. Please try to pick a username that resembles the username 
    in your @iastate.edu email address. Otherwise, please write in your profile either your 
    full name or some other obvious clue that tells me who you are.</li>
<li>While signed in, visit <a href="https://stat305d-spring2013.wikispaces.com/home">
https://stat305d-spring2013.wikispaces.com/home</a> and
request to join. If you are a student, I will accept the request.</li>
</ul>

I created it to encourage 
collaboration. You may use it to discuss
anything related to the class except:

<ul>
  <li>Test problems. There must be absolutely no discussion about test problems. 
  However, you may discuss the <i>practice</i> tests and <i>practice</i> problems 
  posted on the course website.</li>
  <li>Solutions to homework problems. You may ask questions and give hints, 
  but you must not give away solutions.</li>
</ul>

I plan to give extra credit to contributors who are especially active and insightful.
<br/><br/>

<h2>Surveys</h2>

The following surveys are not required, but participation will help your grade.
<ul>
  <li>At the top of the first homework assignment, you will see a link to a survey at 
  surveymonkey.com. I created this survey to find out the distribution of 
  majors in the class and allow students to vote on my office hours. Students
  who complete and submit the survey by 12:40 PM on Thursday, January 24 will 
  receive five percentage points of extra credit on the first homework assignment. </li>
  <li>The Departments of Mathematics and Statistics are jointly conducting a three-year
  study funded by the National Science Foundation to explore the gender gap and the 
  performance of community college transfer students in the STEM sciences. The survey
  will be given at the beginning (week 2)  and at the end of the semester (week 14) 
  through Course Climate and students will receive an e-mail invitation with a link 
  to the survey automatically.<br/><br/>
      
  The exact dates for the survey are:<br/><br/>
  Pre-survey:   01/21 - 01/27/13   until 11 PM<br/>
  Post-survey: 04/22 - 04/28/13   until 11PM<br/><br/>
   
  Students who complete both the pre-survey and the post-survey will receive 
  one percentage point of extra credit on their final grades. 
  </li></ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>

You can check your grades on <a href="https://bb.its.iastate.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">Blackboard</a>.<br/><br/>

Your final grade is a weighted average of homework (25%), exam 1 (25%), 
exam 2 (25%), and the final exam (25%). Your lowest homework grade 
will be dropped before making the calculation. <br/><br/>

For example, suppose:

<ul>
  <li>You earned a total of 889 homework points over the whole semester.</li>
  <li>There were 1100 possible homework point in all.</li>
  <li>Your lowest homework grade was 61 points out of 100.</li>
  <li>You scored a 97% on exam 1.</li>
  <li>You scored a 85% on exam 2.</li>
  <li>You scored a 91% on the final exam.</li>
</ul>
  
Your homework grade with the lowest score dropped is (889 - 61)/(1100 - 100) = 82.8%.<br/>
Your final grade is (82.8% + 97% + 85% + 91%)/4 = 88.95%.<br/> <br/>

I will assign letter grades as follows:<br/><br/>

<table border="1" >
  <tr><th>Letter Grade</th> <th>Percentage Grade X</th></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X &ge; 93.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-</td> <td>89.000% &le; X < 93.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B+</td> <td>86.000% &le; X < 89.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B</td> <td>83.000% &le; X < 86.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-</td> <td>79.000% &le; X < 83.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C+</td> <td>76.000% &le; X < 79.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C</td> <td>73.000% &le; X < 76.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C-</td> <td>69.000% &le; X < 73.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D+</td> <td>66.000% &le; X < 69.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D</td> <td>63.000% &le; X < 66.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D-</td> <td>59.000% &le; X < 63.000%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F</td> <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X < 59.000%</td></tr>
</table><br/><br/>

<h2>Homework</h2>

Homework rules are as follows:

<ul>
  <li style="color:red">SHOW ALL YOUR WORK! THE INSTRUCTOR AND TA KNOW THAT THE ANSWERS TO MANY 
  BOOK PROBLEMS ARE AT THE BACK OF THE BOOK. IF YOU SHOW ONLY PART OF YOUR WORK 
  AND SKIP TO THE ANSWER, WE WILL NOTICE AND YOUR GRADE WILL SUFFER.</li>
  <li>You are encouraged to work on homework with your peers.
  However, your problem sets must be written by you and only 
  you, in your own words, and only with the calculations 
  that you yourself did. You may not copy anything from 
  another studentâ€™s work, an answer key, a solutions manual, 
  or any other resource that has the final answer or solution 
  to a homework problem on any assignment that you have not 
  yet turned in.</li>
  <li>Homework solutions will be emailed individually to those who have 
  completed the respective assignments. You are not allowed to share
  a solution set with a peer who has not completed the assignment. 
  </li>
</ul>

Weekly homework assignments, along with their respective due dates, 
will be posted at <a href="http://wlandau.github.com/materials.html">will-landau.com/stat305/materials.html</a>.
Homeworks will usually be due on Thursdays at the beginning of class.
Submission must be in hard copy form except under extenuating circumstances.<br/><br/>

Each homework assignment is worth 100 points, and the sum of the points you 
earn on homework assignments is your overall homework grade. Your lowest homework
grade is excluded from the calculation of your final grade.<br/><br/>

I will formally extend due dates for individuals with unusual and adverse
circumstances (family crisis, serious illness, etc.). Otherwise, the following
late policy applies:<br/><br/>

<table border="1">
  <tr><td>First late</td> <td><b>No penalty</b> if handed in <b>by</b> April 25 <br/> <b>Score = 0/100</b> if handed in <b>after</b> April 25 </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Second late</td> <td><b>5 point penalty</b> if handed in <b>by</b> April 25 <br/> <b>Score = 0/100</b> if handed in <b>after</b> April 25 </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Third late</td> <td><b>10 point penalty</b> if handed in <b>by</b> April 25 <br/> <b>Score = 0/100</b> if handed in <b>after</b> April 25 </td></tr>
  <tr><td style="text-align:center"><br/>...<br/><br/></td><td style="text-align:center"><br/>...<br/><br/></td></tr>
  <tr><td>n'th late, where n is the <br/> total number of homeworks</td> 
  <td><b>5 &#215; (n-1) point penalty</b> if handed in <b>by</b> April 25 <br/> <b>Score = 0/100</b> if handed in <b>after</b> April 25 </td></tr>
</table><br/><br/>

<h2>Exams</h2>

The exam rules are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>All the usual exam ethics apply. Please ask the instructor if you have questions.</li>
  <li>You may bring ONLY the following materials to the exams:</li>
  <ul type="a">
    <li>A writing utensil.</li>
    <li>An approved hand-held calculator: 
    You will not need anything more powerful than a 4-function calculator,
    but you may bring anything as powerful as a graphing calculator 
    such as a TI-83 or TI-89. However, you may not use anything more 
    sophisticated or powerful than a graphing calculator or a device 
    with networking capabilities (i.e., no computers, tablets, smart phones, 
    cell phones, etc.). Please contact me if you are not sure if your 
    calculator qualifies.</li>
    <li>An 8.5" &#215; 11" sheet of paper of your own notes to help you
    during the exam. You may use both sides of the page, and you may write
    anything you want except for solutions to example problems and exam notes
    copied from another student.
  </ul>
  <li>During an exam, you will be provided with:</li>
  <ul type="a">
    <li>Enough scratch paper.</li>
    <li>Enough computer output (i.e., from JMP) to complete the exam.</li>
    <li>All necessary probability tables, which may include 
   standard normal tables, Student t tables, chisquare tables, or F tables.</li> 
  </ul>
</ul>

Exam information is as follows:<br/><br/>

<table border="1">
  <tr><th>Exam</th><th>Date</th><th>Location</th><th>General Topics</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Exam 1</td><td>Feb 14, 12:40 - 2:00 PM</td><td><a href="http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/roomscheduling/room.asp?room_id=1218">NSRIC 1131</a></td><td>Ch. 1, 2, 3, 4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Exam 2</td><td>Mar 14, 12:40 - 2:00 PM</td><td><a href="http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/roomscheduling/room.asp?room_id=1218">NSRIC 1131</a></td><td>Ch. 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5</td></tr>

  </td><td>Ch. 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 9.1, 9.2</td></tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>

<h2>Lecture Rules</h2>

Please bring your calculators to class because I will often have 
you do in-class exercises. Also, please bring any probability 
tables (standard normal table, Student t table, etc.) to class 
after I have taught you how to use them. <br/><br/>

Other than that, all the usual rules of classroom etiquette apply. 
Please be respectful to your peers and your instructor. 
We need a quiet, distraction-free environment. 
For example: if you want to use your cell phone for anything 
other than checking the date or time, please exit the classroom 
and come back when youâ€™re done. If youâ€™re using a personal computer, 
please only use it to take notes. Screens that show Facebook or 
soccer games are too distracting to your peers.
<br/><br/>

<h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>

This class follows the <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~catalog/2009-2011/geninfo/dishonesty.html">
Iowa State University's policy on academic dishonesty</a> described in the
